      <h2 class="w3-wide">HACKTOBERFEST (10/6/2020)</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Misled Intentions</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> <p>The mistakes DigitalOcean made in this years implementation of Hacktoberfest give insight on how a large platform can miscalculate the consequences of its actions, hurting a community in turn. However, it also shows how quickly justice can be enacted within the software community despite the power difference between larger corporations and smaller developers, a relationship that is not often seen in other areas.</p>

        <p>Though stemming from good intentions, the competition/challenge of "Support open source and pick a limited edition T-shirt or plant a tree." led to an annoying influx of spam within many Github repositories. I don't see how Digital Ocean could have seen this coming, that would have required a good level of foresight, but this problem is increasingly becoming a problem today. On a larger scale, as tech companies grow to immense levels their influence on our communities are only growing. Take Facebooks impact on the 2016 elections, or Twitters combination of cancel culture, trending news and overall "untamed" global connectivity.</p>
        
        <p>Back to the Hacktoberfest example, through a combination of rule(s) on the official website (such as "If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate."), using the topic "hacktoberfest" on github to filter between participating and non participating repositories, and outright apologizing, DigitalOcean attempted to rectify its wrongs. Though I woefully doubt the effect the rule will have on curbing spam-like pull requests (PRs), I do see the filtering solution and public apology as meaningful and sufficient. Honestly, this entire program was built upon good intentions (hence the subtitle), so I can't entirely fault them from trying to do good.</p>
        
        <p>What I found most impressive, though, was the quick turnaround in the implementation of these changes & statements. From what I learned through research, Hacktoberfest begins Oct 1st (obviously), and these changes alongside the apology went out Oct 2nd. Thats a single day. Imagine if you could get massive corporations, governments, companies etc to apologize for their wrongs and get to fixing them in such a short time frame. I do understand that, as a software related issue, changes are in comparison easy to do and relativley inexpensive. But, I still appluad the quick return.</p>

      <h2 class="w3-wide">Android (10/13/2020)</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>All About Android</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> <p>Android is often viewed as the lower tier operating system in young America, and the term "Android" is correspondingly used to refer to any phone with the Android OS to compare it to its more "superior" iOS counterpart. However, with its roots in open source software, Android provides numerous benefits to the average phone user and is undeserving of its second tier status.</p>

        <p>For one, Androids foundational concepts give it an edge over its competitors. As open source software, developers have to go over less hurdles to create apps by virtue of its well documented nature, and the wealth of information available online. This also attracts consumers, since there are is a larger, more diverse and cheaper array of apps and tools avaiable to them.</p>
        
        <p>Android is also helpful towards the consumer/hobbyist. Want to overclock your phones cpu? Delete unnessecary proprietary software? Just mess around with your device because you own it? Android allows you to do all of that. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/root">A simple root will get rid of saftey measures and give you full control over your device.</a></p>
        
        <p>Even if you arent comfortable with changing the system software on your device, having an Android gives you access to the world of good natured Android developers and their safe upgrades. With Android, you are not tied to a corporation for updates or improvements. Even devices not offically supported by Android can still run the operating system, as long as there is someone maintaining support for it.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, there are some misconceptions around the saftey of Android devices. One of the many complaints are ones about privacy, an area where Androids ties to Google do not help it at all. However, these worries are either unfounded or misguided. <a href="https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox">Android applications operate in a sandbox</a>, meaning that they do not directly interact with the files and sensitive software on your phone. Until the user gives explicit information to do so, malicious apps cannot negativley affect the integrity of your information. </p>
        
        <p>However, not all is well in the world of Android. Lately, Google has been stepping away from the "totally free" business model, and Androids global popularity has sparked interest in competitors wishing to get a slice of Androids pie... (to be continued)</p>

        <h2 class="w3-wide">Android Pt. 2: Fair Use and Google vs. Oracle (10/29/2020)</h2>
        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>And why you should care</i></p>
        <p class="w3-justify"> <p>Lots of code goes into developing a widespread operating system like Android OS. As many of you know, this development process can be streamlined by importing code from other sources, aka the basic premises of Open Source Software. Through importing well written and functioning code, time, money and resources can be spent developing other parts of the OS.</p>
  
          <p>For these reasons, Google decided to  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/11/android-java/">use API's and other bits of software from Apache Harmony</a>,  a Java implementation developed by the Apache Software Foundation. Though seemingly innocent, this outsourcing of code would haunt Google in the long run, and lead to multiple court cases over the span of a decade as Oracle (the owner of the Java Standard Edition platform) sued Google over their use of the API's.</p>
          
          <p>Some of these cases have already been decided, such as Oracle's successful attempt to copyright their API's as a result of  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-vs-oracle-the-next-chapter/">the US Court of Appeals (CAFC) overruling a previous juries decision.</a> The case still standing, (and one most relevant today), is whether Fair Use applies to Googles commercial use of the API's. Before analyzing the case, and its ramifications today, we must define what Fair Use is.</p>
          
          <p>Fair Use is a legal doctrine that, under specific circumstances, allows the use of unliscenced copyrighted material in a commercial setting. These specific circumstances include, but are not limited to: whether the material was transformed in such a way to make it uniquely different than its original counterpart, whether the final product is commercial or nonprofit in nature, and whether the use of copyrighted material is too egregious/estensive. Because of the nature of these circumstances, fair use is evaluated "on a case-by-case basis", so even if you follow these circumstances, you are not guaranteed to follow Fair Use. The source of this information, and more, can be found at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html">website of the US Copyright Office</a></p>

          <p>Back to Google vs. Oracle. Since Oracle has already successfully copyrighted their API's, the only way they could win the lawsuit against Android is if they can prove Google's use of the API's did not follow Fair Use. Since Google had used the API's to speed up the development process, had not transformed them in any manner and instead reused them, and had used them in an excessive manner (37 API calls and 11500 lines of code was deemed to much, makes sense), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180327178">it was ruled in 2018 that this was not an example of fair use.</a></p>
          
          <p>Fast forward to 2020, this case has been brought to the Supreme Court by Google to challenge this ruling among others. As evident by it reaching the Supreme Court, this is not simply just a case determining whether Google was operating within Fair Use. In fact, as Supreme Court cases often do, the final ruling of this case will establish a precedent within the software world. Should the ruling fall once and for all in Oracles favor, this could spell drastic changes in the ability of software developers to, well, develop software in a legal and inexpensive manner. This could lead to higher prices in premium or once free software as developers are required to attain licenses to use copyrighted code, instead of reverse engineering their own versions, and at worst could lead to a monopoly in the hands of the few who own the rights to the software.</p>
