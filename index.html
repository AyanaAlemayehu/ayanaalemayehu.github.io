      <h2 class="w3-wide">HACKTOBERFEST (10/6/2020)</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Misled Intentions</i></p>
      <p class="w3-justify"> <p>The mistakes DigitalOcean made in this years implementation of Hacktoberfest give insight on how a large platform can miscalculate the consequences of its actions, hurting a community in turn. However, it also shows how quickly justice can be enacted within the software community despite the power difference between larger corporations and smaller developers, a relationship that is not often seen in other areas.</p>

        <p>Though stemming from good intentions, the competition/challenge of "Support open source and pick a limited edition T-shirt or plant a tree." led to an annoying influx of spam within many Github repositories. I don't see how Digital Ocean could have seen this coming, that would have required a good level of foresight, but this problem is increasingly becoming a problem today. On a larger scale, as tech companies grow to immense levels their influence on our communities are only growing. Take Facebooks impact on the 2016 elections, or Twitters combination of cancel culture, trending news and overall "untamed" global connectivity.</p>
        
        <p>Back to the Hacktoberfest example, through a combination of rule(s) on the official website (such as "If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate."), using the topic "hacktoberfest" on github to filter between participating and non participating repositories, and outright apologizing, DigitalOcean attempted to rectify its wrongs. Though I woefully doubt the effect the rule will have on curbing spam-like pull requests (PRs), I do see the filtering solution and public apology as meaningful and sufficient. Honestly, this entire program was built upon good intentions (hence the subtitle), so I can't entirely fault them from trying to do good.</p>
        
        <p>What I found most impressive, though, was the quick turnaround in the implementation of these changes & statements. From what I learned through research, Hacktoberfest begins Oct 1st (obviously), and these changes alongside the apology went out Oct 2nd. Thats a single day. Imagine if you could get massive corporations, governments, companies etc to apologize for their wrongs and get to fixing them in such a short time frame. I do understand that, as a software related issue, changes are in comparison easy to do and relativley inexpensive. But, I still appluad the quick return.</p>
